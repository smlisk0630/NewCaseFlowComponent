This repository houses my Lightning Aura Component, which I created to call a Screen Flow via a Global Action.

The Flow creates a new Case with lookup field visibility dependent on the value of the Type field. It also includes a File Upload component to allow attachment of screenshots.

The field visibility is a condition of the QuickChoice Component from Alex Edelstein's FlowBasePacks on UnofficialSF.

## Preqrequisites
